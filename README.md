## **Tasks Overview**

### **1. Iris Flower Classification**
- **Objective:** Classify Iris flowers into Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica based on petal and sepal dimensions.
- **Key Steps:**
  - Preprocessing Iris dataset (`Iris.csv`)
  - Training a classifier (e.g., Logistic Regression)
  - Visualizing results with confusion matrix & pie chart
  - Interactive GUI for predictions

### **2. Car Price Prediction**
- **Objective:** Predict selling price of used cars based on features like brand, mileage, fuel type, etc.
- **Key Steps:**
  - Data cleaning and label encoding (`cardata.csv`)
  - Regression model training
  - Model evaluation (MAE, RMSE, RÂ²)
  - GUI for file upload, training, and prediction
